# Regression controller

This directory owns the CI controller for the [Playwright regression scenarios](../../../tests/e2e/regression/README.md).
It controls only the application recorded in its isolated run directory; it never discovers or stops a developer's Electron instance.

## Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cases.ts` | Case IDs, titles, task tags, phases, required capabilities, and selection |
| `cli.ts`, `phases.ts` | CLI entry points and one Playwright invocation per selected phase |
| `installation.ts`, `artifacts.ts` | Release installation, asset selection, and hashing |
| `lifecycle.ts` | Start, reuse, restart, and stop the owned application |
| `process.ts` | OS process identity, ancestry, ports, and termination |
| `debugBridge.ts`, `cdpClient.ts` | Explicit main-process debug operations and HTTP callback delivery |
| `systemAutomation.ts` | Native dialogs, external text selection, and keyboard input |
| `RegressionReporter.ts` | Playwright result adapter and run-state updates |
| `state.ts`, `report.ts` | Run state, platform/aggregate verdicts, and human-readable reports |
| `fixtureFiles.ts`, `paths.ts`, `config.ts` | Input fixtures, run-owned paths, and configuration |

Dependencies flow from CLI and E2E fixtures into these modules. The controller does not import E2E scenarios or production services.
The debug bridge may inspect the owned main process; it must never manufacture a successful product result.
The explicit profile/restart operation prepares Windows connections by closing non-main windows before CDP attaches; simply locating a window does not perform this preparation. Both branch and installer launches enable the main-process inspector for this explicit compatibility step.

## Execution contract

Branch runs prepare `rebuild:electron` and `build:utility-process` once after installing
application dependencies. The controller then launches the development server directly,
including on profile switches and persistence-test restarts. Local controller runs must
perform the same preparation in the target checkout before `launch`; release installers
do not need it. Restarting still stops the owned application and preserves its profile.

The workflow keeps eleven separately timed steps. Each calls `run-phase`; the controller intersects its phase with the run's selected task and returns immediately for unselected phases.
`cases.ts` is the execution manifest. The workflow task dropdown lists `all` and every task ID from the manifest. When adding a task, update the workflow options too; the manifest tests enforce that the lists stay in sync.

`run.json` schema version 2 records both cases and phases. The parent marks a phase running before starting Playwright; the reporter records test results and executor errors; a nonzero child exit also fails the phase.
A phase left pending/running becomes blocked during finalization. Passing cases cannot hide a failed or unfinished phase. Missing platform reports block the aggregate gate.
Only one phase writes a platform's run state at a time; keep `workers: 1` and sequential workflow steps.
The default macOS and Windows jobs run in parallel; `platforms: windows` selects only Windows. Each selected platform keeps its own isolated run directory, and report aggregation requires exactly those selected platforms.
Test names and generated report text use English. External errors and captured application content remain unchanged.

Capability requirements belong to cases. Missing required capabilities skip execution with an explicit reason and are recorded as blocked, never passed.
Capability probes are preflight checks, not evidence that a product interaction succeeded.

Service configuration is checked per selected case by `config.ts`; `all` keeps the full configuration requirement. `preflight --task notes` needs no service credentials. `export-config --task ...` writes only required single-line values to `GITHUB_ENV`, without logging values. Local cases require no chat, embedding, Anthropic or CherryIN service. The Playwright fixture loads configuration for its own case, including during failure capture.

Code-tool installation/cache steps run only for selections containing code-tool cases. The trusted `main` controller can also test a complete commit SHA explicitly listed by a repository administrator in `CHERRY_TEST_TRUSTED_SHAS`. Feature/PR ref names and unlisted SHAs remain rejected; approval never follows a moving branch. Keep administrator-reviewed SHA approvals separate from dispatch input. See the [fork runbook](../../../docs/contrib/fork-ci.md) for settings and permissions.

## Combined report

The aggregate job publishes `test-report`. Download and extract
it, then open `index.html` to browse every platform and phase in one HTML
report, including failures and attachments. The same artifact contains
`summary.md`. Only the aggregate job writes GitHub's summary: platform
counts, actionable case/phase issues, and a cross-platform case table. Full
platform reports, logs, fixtures, and generated files are bundled under
`evidence/macos` and `evidence/windows` without duplication in the summary.
After the complete bundle is uploaded, the aggregate job deletes only this run's
temporary `test-evidence-macos` and `test-evidence-windows` artifacts. If download,
assembly, or upload fails, temporary artifacts are retained for diagnosis.
When the platform jobs succeeded, an aggregate-only rerun can recover missing
temporary artifacts from the previous bundle. Failed platform jobs never fall
back to old evidence. Rerunning a job replaces its same-named artifact.

Collection accepts both artifact-name subdirectories and a single artifact extracted
directly into the download root. Flat platform reports are matched by their recorded
platform; a flat previous combined bundle is reused only after successful platform jobs.

Each phase retains a blob report with a platform/phase-specific filename. The aggregate
job uses Playwright's built-in `merge-reports` with an explicit test root for cross-OS
paths. Bundled platform evidence retains raw logs and generated files. The JSON
aggregate verdict remains authoritative, including missing or interrupted phases.

## Verification

- `pnpm exec vitest run --project scripts scripts/e2e/regression`
- `pnpm typecheck:e2e`
- `CHERRY_TEST_RUN_DIR=/tmp/cherry-regression-list pnpm test:e2e:regression --list`
- `pnpm lint` and `pnpm docs:check`

Enumeration does not launch Electron or require an initialized run. Desktop acceptance requires every selected hosted platform and the aggregate gate; Windows-only evidence does not certify macOS.
