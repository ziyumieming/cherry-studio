description: Developer environment setup covering IDE configuration, Windows symlink support, and project install steps

# 🖥️ Develop

## IDE Setup

### VSCode like

- Editor: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), etc. Any VS Code compatible editor.
- Recommended extensions are listed in [`.vscode/extensions.json`](../../.vscode/extensions.json).

### Zed

1. Install the [Oxc extension](https://github.com/oxc-project/zed-oxc) for Oxfmt and Oxlint.
2. Copy the example settings file to your local Zed config:
   ```bash
   cp .zed/settings.json.example .zed/settings.json
   ```
3. Customize `.zed/settings.json` as needed (it is git-ignored).

## Windows: Enable Symlinks

This project uses symlinks to synchronize files such as AGENTS.md and skills. Windows developers must enable symlink support before cloning:

1. **Enable Developer Mode** (Settings → Update & Security → For developers), or grant `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` via `secpol.msc`.
2. **Configure Git**:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.symlinks true
   ```
3. Clone (or re-clone) the repository after enabling symlink support.

## Project Setup

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Setup Node.js

The required Node.js version is defined in `.node-version`. Use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install it automatically:

```bash
nvm install
```

### Setup pnpm

The pnpm version is locked in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`. Just enable corepack and it will use the correct version automatically:

```bash
corepack enable
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### ENV

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Start

```bash
pnpm dev
```

By default, development runs append `Dev` to Electron's default `userData`
directory, keeping local dev data separate from packaged app data. To run
an entirely isolated development profile, set an absolute profile root in
`.env`:

```bash
CS_DEV_PROFILE_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/cherry-profile
```

This keeps Cherry home, BootConfig, legacy config discovery, Electron
`userData`, and logs under that root. The root cannot be relative or the
filesystem root, and packaged builds ignore it. When set, it takes precedence
over `CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX`.

| Data | Isolated location |
|------|-------------------|
| Cherry home and BootConfig | `{profileRoot}/.cherrystudio` |
| Electron `userData` | `{profileRoot}/userData` |
| Application logs | `{profileRoot}/logs` |

For lightweight isolation of multiple development instances, give each
instance a unique userData suffix. You can set it in `.env`:

```bash
CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX=DevQuito
```

Or pass it inline when starting a dev instance:

```bash
CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX=DevQuito pnpm dev
CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX=DevParis pnpm dev
```

The suffix must be a single path component (no path separator, drive colon,
`* ? " < > |`, control character, or trailing dot). Blank values fall back to
`Dev`; anything else that breaks those rules stops the dev run instead of
falling back, so two instances never end up sharing one directory.

### Debug

```bash
pnpm debug
```

Then input chrome://inspect in browser

### Validate changes

```bash
pnpm check --plan
pnpm check
pnpm check --base <parent-branch> --plan
pnpm check:all
```

`check` includes all branch changes since the merge base with `origin/main`, plus staged,
unstaged, and untracked files. Use `--base` for the parent of a stacked branch. Ordinary
Markdown selects only formatting and documentation checks; runtime resources and unknown
paths conservatively select more checks. Missing comparison history selects the full gate.

`pnpm lint` only runs read-only Oxlint and ESLint checks. Use `pnpm lint:fix` to apply lint
fixes and `pnpm format` to format files. Type checking and i18n validation are separate tasks
selected by `check`. `pnpm typecheck` runs compilers serially. Local Vitest uses two workers;
override with `--maxWorkers=N` when needed. CI retains its runner worker limit.

### Test

```bash
pnpm test:main src/main/path/to/example.test.ts
pnpm test:renderer src/renderer/path/to/example.test.ts
pnpm test
```

`pnpm test` runs all registered projects in one invocation; file arguments apply to all
projects. Each coding agent should use its own worktree and dependency installation.
Main-process tests rebuild SQLite for Node, while `pnpm dev` rebuilds it for Electron:
do not run both concurrently against the same worktree's native binary.

See [Validation tooling](../../scripts/validation/README.md) for selection rules and task groups.

### Build

```bash
# For windows
$ pnpm build:win

# For macOS
$ pnpm build:mac

# For Linux
$ pnpm build:linux
```

For architecture-specific commands and the pinned `better-sqlite3` prebuild workflow, see
[Linux Packaging](./linux-packaging.md).
